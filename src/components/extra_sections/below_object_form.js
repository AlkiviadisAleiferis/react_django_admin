Create your components and map them in
the mapping below, with the convention:

    `${app_name}_${model_name}`: Component

In `ObjectPreview` the `object` prop is passed
In `ObjectEdit` the `fields` prop is passed

See `BelowFormDefaultSection` Component for example

This file will be avoided to change
